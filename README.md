# Table detetection and table structure recognition
 Table detetection and table structure recognition
Yolo and Faster RCNN both have been tried for table detection. 
The code for Faster RCNN has been used to detect apples. For table dataset similar transformation can be done.
Post table detetcion, multiple algorithms for table structure identification have been used.
